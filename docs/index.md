# SatFlow 🔁

**Automate your automations.**

*Production flow calculations for Satisfactory.*

## Quick Start

That's it. ✨

## Key Features



## Verify Your Install

SatFlow includes a built-in self-check — no pytest required.  
You can verify that the script works correctly on your system by running:

```bash
python3 satflow.py --selftest
```

This creates a tiny temporary project, stitches a few test files, and confirms it completes successfully.  
If you see a ✅ "Self-test passed" message, your installation is working perfectly.

## Documentation

## License

[MIT-a-NOAI License](https://github.com/apathetic-tools/satflow/blob/main/LICENSE)

You're free to use, copy, and modify the script under the standard MIT terms.  
The additional rider simply requests that this project not be used to train or fine-tune AI/ML systems until the author deems fair compensation frameworks exist.  
Normal use, packaging, and redistribution for human developers are unaffected.
